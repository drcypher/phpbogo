=====================

JSON Controllers for Yii applications.

Latest version: 1.0 (23 Mar 2012)

##Requirements

This has been tested on Yii 1.1.10+

##Features

###Action Input parameters

You define your input parameters as objects, which are actually the JSON-decoded payload of your
caller's request. Decoding and validation takes place transparently, as long as your input object
is a subclass of `CBJsonModel`.

###Action Return values
You return your action's response with `return` instead of `render`. It's highly *suggested*
that your return objects are subtypes of CBJsonModel or arrays of such objects. Still, this is a
suggestion, of course you can return anything that json_encode() accepts, as long as you trust what
you're exposing to your caller.

###PHPdoc for your json services
The above allow for automatic documentation of your services, e.g. using apigen. The produced
documentation can be then published and let your clients/callers know exactly what they should pass
as input and what to expect as output.

###Consistent error and exception handling
Error handling is done automatically, i.e. whenever an exception or PHP error is thrown, a
standard-format JSON is returned which your caller may then parse and handle.

## Installation

### Get the code

Download and extract the code into `/protected/extensions/bogo-yii-json-service/` folder.

### Make it visible

Add the following line in the import array of your `/protected/config/main.php` to make the
extensions classes visible to your code:

```php
return array(
	// [..]

	// autoloading model and component classes
	'import'=>array(
		// [..]
		'ext.bogo-yii-json-service.components.*',
		// [..]
	),

	// [..]
);
```

### Configure Yii Request Application Component

Add the following lines in your `/protected/config/main.php` to enable CBHttpRequest functionality
in place of Yii's standard CHttpRequest class:

```php
return array(
	// [..]

	// application components
	'components'=>array(
		// [..]

		// Use json-capable http request
		'request'=>array(
			'class'=>'CBHttpRequest',
		),

		// [..]
	),
	// [..]
);
```

## Usage

### Quick sample

Below a sample code which highlights the usage of JSON capabilities. Things you should keep are:

1. The controller `extends` the `CBJsonController` component
2. The method accepts a `ProductQueryJson` object instead of looking into `$_GET`/`$_POST`
3. The method `return`s an array of `ProductJson` objects instead of calling `$this->render()`

```php
class ProductController extends CBJsonController
{
	/**
	 * Find products.
	 *
	 * @param ProductQueryJson $queryJson Query criteria
	 * @return ProductJson[] Matching products
	 */
	public function actionFindProduct(ProductQueryJson $queryJson)
	{
		$foundProducts = Product::model()->scopeApplyQuery($queryJson)->findAll();

		return ProductJson::createMany($foundProducts);
	}
}
```

### Your API's public documentation

Here's the [demo controller documentation](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/drcypher/bogo-yii-json-service/master/demo/docs/class-ProductController.html)
you get by using this extension in conjunction with proper phpdoc comments and [apigen](http://apigen.org/).
